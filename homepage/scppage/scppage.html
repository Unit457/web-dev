        <p>Hello. If you're watching this, then congratulations; you have been especially chosen to be a part of the most expensive secret organization in the history of mankind — <b>the SCP Foundation.</b><br>
        What is the SCP Foundation? We are an international covert agency tasked with the monitoring and containment of paranormal entities and anomalies.<br>
        To put it bluntly, <i>we protect you from the things you <u>don't know about.</u></i></p>

            <p class="topic">Creepypastas</p>
            <p class="topictext">It's easier to understand SCP if you understand this concept.<br>
            Creepypastas are digital text that tell fictional horror stories usually created by internet users and shared around the web.<br>
            Several creepypastas became extremely famous as the internet aged, eventually growing into other type of media beyond just text, such as images, games, short films, etc.<br>
            The SCP Foundation originates from a creepypasta.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="topic">SCP-173</p>
            <p class="topictext">The SCP Foundation was first mentioned in a 2008 post on a 4chan forum that discussed a creature designated SCP-173, making it the first SCP to exist. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173", target="_blank", style="color:rgb(174, 174, 255)">(https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173)</a><br>
            The post consisted of text accompanied by an image, which were:</p>

            <br>
            <code><p class="topictext", style="text-align: justify;"><big><b> Special Containment Procedures:</b></big> Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times. When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them. At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.<br>
            <br>
            <big><b>Description:</b></big> Moved to Site-19 1993. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173. Personnel assigned to enter container are instructed to alert one another before blinking. Object is reported to attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation. In the event of an attack, personnel are to observe Class 4 hazardous object containment procedures.<br>
            <br>
            Personnel report sounds of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one is present inside. This is considered normal, and any change in this behaviour should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty.<br></p></code>

            <p class="topic">Repercussion</p>
            <p class="topictext">Through the wording, formatting, style and overall aesthetics, the text conveys the air of some kind of secret document, apparently from an organization that contains creatures and anomalies that exhibit supernatural phenomena.<br>
            And that's how the concept of the Foundation was born.<br>
            The creepypasta gained significant internet attention over time and grew increasingly popular; people had greatly enjoyed the idea of a secret, international, non-governmental organization whose objective was to secure, contain and protect any anomalies found in our reality that defied known natural laws, making these anomalies incomprehensible to human science and often threatening the integrity of our society, humanity, or even reality itself.<br>
            With this idea in mind, the SCP Foundation website was created, where users could create their own SCP.<br>
            Nowadays the website has over 6000 registered SCPs, administrators, many writers and readers, discussion forums, stories and a big engaged community in the objective of keeping this fantasy alive.<br>
            Beyond the website, there are many games, songs, videos, short films, animations and other type of media related to the SCP Foundation.</p><br>
            <p class="topic">The Expansion of the SCP Universe</p>
            <p class="topictext">As you can see, the SCP Foundation became an entire universe of itself.<br>
            People started to imagine in the most realistic way possible how the existence of these creatures would modify the real world.<br>
            Many types of groups were created (called groups of interest by the Foundation), from government bodies that were made to include certain countries in the anomalous world scenario (FBI: Unusual Incidents Unit; GRU: Division "Psychotronics") to criminal or terrorist organizations that act for their own objectives and interests (Marshall, Carter & Dark, Ltda.; Chaos Insurgency).<br>
            It was also imagined how an SCP site (the place where the anomalies are contained) would operate. Each sector, department, procedure, operation, etc. This is where concepts as the Security Department, the Class-D's, the Scientific Department and others were born, very present in media such as games, movies and even the website itself.<br>
            We also can't talk about SCP without mentioning the famous Mobile Task Forces, the Foundation's best operatives, each unit specializing in certain operating conditions and anomalous phenomena.<br>
            It's impossible to mention everything here, but these are some of examples of what was created from this community.<br>
            <br>
            And this is the SCP Foundation's universe, a very big internet roleplay that spins around thinking of how our world would change if anomalies such as these existed.</p>
